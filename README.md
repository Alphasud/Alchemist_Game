 Alchemist_Game is my first Java project. It is a text adventure game.
 At first the project was a "make your own adventure" game played in console.
 With the help of a the community I was able to rewrite the game using the
 swing  framework. 
Major change on 27 fev 2020 : re modeled the code to make multi-class.
